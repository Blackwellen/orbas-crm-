     NOTE ON NAMING (added during Orbas setup):
     This checklist was originally authored for "Propvora", a property-management
     SaaS, and reused here as the release-readiness contract for **Orbas CRM**.
     All "Propvora" references have been renamed to "Orbas". Some domain-specific
     terms from the source template remain (e.g. "/property-manager/home" as the
     styling benchmark, plus "tenancy / arrears / deposits / operator / property").
     Read those as their generic Orbas equivalents:
       • /property-manager/home   → the app home benchmark, /app/home
       • property / operator      → workspace / tenant / module record
       • tenancy / arrears / etc. → whatever the relevant module's records are
     The release process (audit every route, fix UI/data/RLS/perf/security, write
     evidence docs, score 100/100) applies unchanged to Orbas.

# Component architecture — modular, not monolithic (HARD RULE)

Build everything from small, single-purpose component files. Never inline a table,
charts, tabs, and dialogs into one giant `page.tsx`. Full detail lives in CLAUDE.md
("Component Architecture — Modular, Not Monolithic"); the essentials:

- **One component, one file.** `page.tsx` is a thin container that composes children.
- **Tables are their own file** (`<entity>-table.tsx`), prop-driven; the list page owns
  state/filters and renders the table.
- **Co-locate route-private pieces** in an underscore folder next to the route
  (`_components/`, `_tabs/`) — Next.js treats `_`-prefixed folders as private (not routes).
- **Shared, cross-module composites** live in `src/components/` (detail/, charts/, data/,
  board/, media/, map/, timeline/, marketing/) — never duplicated inline.
- **Detail / profile pages compose the scaffold** in `src/components/detail/`
  (`DetailShell` + `EntityHero` + `DetailTabs` + per-tab files + `RecordSummaryPanel`).
  **Deep tabs become real sub-routes** (`[id]/<tab>/page.tsx`) so each tab is its own
  deep-linkable file; lighter tabs may be in-page but each panel is still its own file.

When a release checklist item says "use shared primitives / no one-off components", this
modular rule is how you satisfy it.

Claude Code: before doing anything, read CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md in full and follow them as the standing project rules. Then treat the section checklist pasted below as the exact release-readiness contract for this Orbas area: inspect the real app with Chrome MCP across desktop/tablet/mobile/PWA, click and test every relevant route/control/action, fix all UI, data, Supabase/RLS, permissions, feature flags, gates, integrations, tests and security issues, create the required /release-gated/docs/... and /release-gated/user-fixes/... files, and do not mark complete until the section is 100/100 release-ready.

Note: there's a second, simpler "Smart Rules" catalogue in catalogue.ts used by the rule-based engine — 57 triggers + 21 actions. These are what recipes actually compile against (e.g. compliance_due_soon, rent_overdue, tenancy_ending, gas_cert_expiring … / create_task, draft_message, send_webhook, archive_record …). Tell me if you want that catalogue listed in full too.

3. Integration types to set up
From integrations-catalog.ts — 22 integrations across 7 categories. connectType tells you the setup path:
Category	Integration	Setup type
Accounting	Xero	OAuth (/api/integrations/xero/auth)
	QuickBooks	OAuth
	Sage	API key
	FreeAgent	OAuth
Payments	Stripe	OAuth (/api/integrations/stripe/auth)
	GoCardless	API key
	PayPoint	API key
Property portals	Rightmove	API key
	Zoopla	API key
	OnTheMarket	API key
	SpareRoom	API key
Calendar	Google Calendar	OAuth
	Outlook / Microsoft 365	OAuth
	Apple Calendar	API key (iCal feed)
Communications	Resend	API key
	Twilio	API key
	WhatsApp Business	API key
Storage	Google Drive	OAuth
	Dropbox	API key
	OneDrive	OAuth
CRM	Salesforce	Coming soon
	HubSpot	Coming soon
Setup work: OAuth ones (9) need a registered app + client ID/secret + callback route (callback routes already exist for xero, stripe, outlook, google-drive, google-calendar, gocardless). API-key ones (11) just need credential capture UI. CRM (2) are stubbed "coming soon."
The three connectType values to wire are: oauth, api_key, coming_soon.
________________________________________
4. All webhook types to set up
There are two distinct webhook surfaces in automations — both need setup:
A. Inbound webhook receiver — automation_webhook_endpoints table, node webhook.incoming (_lib.ts)
•	Public URL: /api/automations/trigger/{token} (256-bit base64url token)
•	Optional one-time HMAC signing secret (stored only as SHA-256 secret_hash)
•	Two verification paths: simple (sha256(secret) in X-Orbas-Signature) and strong (HMAC-SHA256(body, secret))
•	Delivery statuses to handle: accepted · rejected · rate_limited · error
•	Purpose: lets Zapier / Make / external apps trigger a review-first run
B. Outbound webhooks — automation_webhooks table, node webhook.outgoing (outbound-webhooks/route.ts)
•	Orbas → external HTTPS endpoint (enforced https://)
•	Subscribed event_types are a free-form string array (min 1) — not a fixed enum in code, so you choose which automation events to emit
•	Optional shared secret → sent as X-Orbas-Token header
•	Test delivery fires an event_type: "test.webhook" POST; deliveries logged to automation_webhook_logs
Setup gap to note: the outbound event_types has no canonical enum defined anywhere — it's validated only as z.array(z.string()).min(1). If you want a curated event-type picker (e.g. compliance.expiring, payment.received, booking.confirmed, task.overdue, run.completed), that list needs to be defined — it doesn't exist yet. Want me to draft that canonical outbound-event-type registry?
Remember the user sets up webhooks and integrations with their own details we don’t set up for them
